Port Windows Live Writer plugin "VS Paste" to Open Live Writer. 

Many thanks to Douglas Stockwell, the original author of Windows Live Writer plugin "VS Paste", which is very old code. The original download page http://plugins.live.com/writer/detail/paste-from-visual-studio is removed by Microsoft. And the original author's website is also down http://www.11011.net/software/vs2html.
